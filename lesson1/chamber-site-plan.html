            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>The Rexburg Chamber works to continually educate its members. Forums are extremely valuable. They are a chance for members to network and share ideas, as well as to obtain pertinent information for the area. It has been fun to watch information be dispensed and then used by different businesses in Rexburg. This shows me that they have learned and applied the principles from our forums.</p>

            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p>What events will the chamber be holding this month that promote business-to-business networking? Where can I find contact information for the chamber's board of directors? What has been the population growth in the area?</p>
